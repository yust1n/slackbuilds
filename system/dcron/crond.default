# Default log level is "notice". If you want cron to actually log activity
# to /var/log/cron, then change "-l notice" to "-l info" to increase the
# logging level.
#
# Valid log levels are:
# alert, crit, debug, emerg, err, error (deprecated synonym for err),
# info, notice, panic (deprecated synonym for emerg), warning,
# warn (deprecated synonym for warning).
